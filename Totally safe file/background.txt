This was a joke file I made to look like a virus (I did a terrible job at it). As you can see by running it, it gets pretty repetative quickly. The remake is much more random (but still outputs your named the sea of random text).

DISCLAIMER: The file is actually safe, it's not a virus. Look at the code if you don't believe me.
