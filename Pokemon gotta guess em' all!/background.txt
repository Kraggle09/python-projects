This is a guessing game I made several years back, where you would guess the type of the pokemon named (for example, charizard is the flame pokemon). As you can see in the old script, I never actually finished it, but it would've been wildly inefficient. The remake is actually complete (asides from the obvious lack of options, which I don't care to add), and much more expandable and efficient.
