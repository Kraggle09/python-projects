# python-projects
A bunch of small python scripts I've created over the years  

To run these scripts, you'll need python installed (obviously) as well as any libraries I use in the files. They're noted at the top of the script.  

Some scripts I made years ago, and some I made more recently. I've also remade several to show the difference in my skill over the years.
